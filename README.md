Project On Insurance Fraud Claims Prediction

# Table Of Contents:
### Objective Of The Project
- <font color=blue>Identify the potential fraudulent insurance claims for your organization</font>

### Why is this a problem?
- <font color=blue>If we look at the yearly data the annual cost of fraud claims in the country(USA) could be as high as about 193billion pound/year</font>

### How big is this problem for an insurance organization?
- <font color=blue>And most of the insurance sector's losses are about 9.8% a year, related to suspecious claim activities with an estimated 20 frauds/day and for a year this numebr adds upto 17k number of fraud claims. Which is a big enough to make an financial impact on an organization</font>

### What is the cost associated with it?
- <font color=blue>Nearly 54% of insurers believe that fraud stands as the threat number one. It affects all insurance companies and all classes of business, compelling customers to bear its consequences in terms of the costs incurred while insurers have to endure the damage sustained by their image and reputation. Fraud is usually associated with insurance all along the life span of the contract, from the stage of underwriting until the notification of the claim. Consequently, the effort invested to counter it has become essential for insurers</font>

### Who pays the cost incase of such activity?
- <font color=blue>Fraudulent activities affect the lives of innocent people, both directly through accidental or intentional injury or damage, 
and indirectly by the crimes leading to higher insurance premiums. 
The innocent people suffer due to acts of fraudsters. 
Insurers increase the amount of premium paid by the payors. 
The genuine claims may also be treated with suspicion sometimes.
